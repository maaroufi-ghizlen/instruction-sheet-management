# RolesGuard Issue Resolution

## Problem Overview

The user-service was failing to start due to dependency injection issues with the `RolesGuard` and `DepartmentGuard` classes. The error message was:

```
ERROR [ExceptionHandler] Nest can't resolve dependencies of the RolesGuard (?). 
Please make sure that the argument Reflector at index [0] is available in the AppModule context.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Guard Architecture Issue**
The `RolesGuard` and `DepartmentGuard` classes (from the shared package) require a `Reflector` instance to be injected into their constructors. The `Reflector` is used to read metadata from decorators like `@Roles()` and `@RequireDepartmentAccess()`.

### 2. **Local vs Global Guard Registration**
Initially, the guards were being used in two conflicting ways:
- **Local usage**: `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)` on individual controller methods
- **Global usage**: Registered as `APP_GUARD` providers in `AppModule`

### 3. **Dependency Injection Context Problem**
When guards are registered as global guards using `APP_GUARD`, NestJS tries to instantiate them at the application level. However, the original registration used `useClass: RolesGuard`, which doesn't provide a way to inject the required `Reflector` dependency.

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### Step 1: Remove Local Guard Usage
**Problem**: Controllers were using `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)` decorators, which caused NestJS to look for the guard in the local module context.

**Solution**: Removed all local `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)` and `@UseGuards(DepartmentGuard)` decorators from controllers.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/users/users.controller.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
@Get('stats')
@UseGuards(RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)
async getUserStats() {
  // ...
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
@Get('stats')
@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)  // RolesGuard is now applied globally
async getUserStats() {
  // ...
}
```

### Step 2: Clean Up Module Providers
**Problem**: The `UsersModule` was attempting to provide `RolesGuard` and `DepartmentGuard` locally with custom factory functions.

**Solution**: Removed these providers from `UsersModule` since the guards are now global.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/users/users.module.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
providers: [
  UsersService,
  UserOwnershipGuard,
  Reflector,
  // ‚úÖ Provide guards with factory to inject Reflector
  {
    provide: RolesGuard,
    useFactory: (reflector: Reflector) => new RolesGuard(reflector),
    inject: [Reflector],
  },
  {
    provide: DepartmentGuard,
    useFactory: (reflector: Reflector) => new DepartmentGuard(reflector),
    inject: [Reflector],
  },
],
```

**After**:
```typescript
providers: [
  UsersService,
  UserOwnershipGuard,
],
```

### Step 3: Fix Global Guard Registration
**Problem**: The global guard registration in `AppModule` used `useClass`, which doesn't handle dependency injection properly.

**Solution**: Changed to use factory functions that explicitly inject the `Reflector` dependency.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app.module.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useClass: RolesGuard,
},
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useClass: DepartmentGuard,
},
```

**After**:
```typescript
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useFactory: (reflector: Reflector) => new RolesGuard(reflector),
  inject: [Reflector],
},
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useFactory: (reflector: Reflector) => new DepartmentGuard(reflector),
  inject: [Reflector],
},
```

### Step 4: Clean Up Imports
**Problem**: Controller files were importing `RolesGuard` and `DepartmentGuard` classes that were no longer used locally.

**Solution**: Removed unused imports to clean up the codebase.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/users/users.controller.ts`

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why Factory Functions Work
When using `useFactory` with `inject`, NestJS:
1. Resolves the `Reflector` dependency first
2. Passes it to the factory function
3. Uses the returned instance as the guard

```typescript
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useFactory: (reflector: Reflector) => new RolesGuard(reflector),
  inject: [Reflector],
}
```

### Why `useClass` Failed
When using `useClass`, NestJS tries to instantiate the class directly but can't resolve the constructor dependencies in the global context:

```typescript
// This fails because NestJS can't inject Reflector into RolesGuard's constructor
{
  provide: APP_GUARD,
  useClass: RolesGuard,  // ‚ùå No way to inject dependencies
}
```

### Guard Execution Order
With the current setup, guards execute in this order:
1. `JwtAuthGuard` (authentication)
2. `RolesGuard` (role-based authorization)
3. `DepartmentGuard` (department-based authorization)
4. `ThrottlerGuard` (rate limiting) - applied per-controller
5. `UserOwnershipGuard` (resource ownership) - applied per-endpoint

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Cleaner Code**
- No need for `@UseGuards(RolesGuard)` on every protected endpoint
- Role-based access control is centralized and consistent

### 2. **Better Performance**
- Guards are instantiated once and reused across all requests
- No repeated guard instantiation per request

### 3. **Consistent Security**
- All endpoints automatically get authentication and authorization checks
- Harder to accidentally forget to protect an endpoint

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Changes to guard logic affect all endpoints automatically
- Single point of configuration for global security

## How Role-Based Access Control Works Now

### 1. **Public Endpoints**
Use `@Public()` decorator to bypass authentication:
```typescript
@Get('health')
@Public()
async healthCheck() {
  return { status: 'ok' };
}
```

### 2. **Authenticated Endpoints**
No decorators needed - authentication is automatic:
```typescript
@Get('profile')
async getProfile(@CurrentUser() user: any) {
  return user;
}
```

### 3. **Role-Protected Endpoints**
Use `@Roles()` decorator:
```typescript
@Get('admin-only')
@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN)
async adminEndpoint() {
  return { message: 'Admin access granted' };
}
```

### 4. **Department-Protected Endpoints**
Use `@RequireDepartmentAccess()` decorator:
```typescript
@Get('department/:id/users')
@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.PREPARATEUR)
@RequireDepartmentAccess()
async getDepartmentUsers(@Param('id') departmentId: string) {
  return this.usersService.getUsersByDepartment(departmentId);
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Global Guards**: Use factory functions with dependency injection for complex guards
2. **Avoid Mixed Patterns**: Don't mix local and global guard usage for the same guard type
3. **Dependency Context**: Understand NestJS dependency injection contexts (module vs. global)
4. **Clean Architecture**: Keep security concerns centralized and consistent

## Future Considerations

1. **Guard Ordering**: The order of global guards matters - authentication should come before authorization
2. **Performance**: Consider caching guard results for frequently accessed endpoints
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error messages for different authorization failures
4. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests for all guard scenarios
